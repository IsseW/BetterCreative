# Better Creative

This mod actually adds a fucking creative mode to the game. Now what does that actually mean?

- It adds a creative drawer to your inventory.
- It lets you fly by double-tapping space. Press N to disable collision while flying.
- It gives you unlimited health, stamina and health, and disables those UI elements as they're redundant.
- It makes sure any mob or structure you hit will be fucking obliterated. In order to prevent accidents, tool requirements still apply, so you either one-shot something or it takes no damage. There is no inbetween.
- It adds a command ``/dontdestroyneighbo[u]rs`` or ``/ddn`` for short, which prevents structures from breaking when connected structures break. It's enabled by default in creative mode.
- It adds a "Precision Delete" tool which is also to prevent accidents, it only works when ``/dontdestroyneighbors`` is enabled. Hold Left Alt to also let this select triggers. What difference does it make? None, but it's there for futureproofing another mod of mine.
- It prevents mobs from spawning naturally, so the only way they spawn is through shrines. And that's your fault if you spawn them.
- It freezes the day loop, which prevents any natural events such as boss spawns (and who knows what else in the future) from occuring.
- It prevents items from being consumed when used. This gives you unlimited food (which is a waste, since you already don't need food) and most importantly, structures don't disappear from your hotbar after being built. Even a million builds later when your game looks like a single screenshot, you'll still have that structure.
- Not only does it prevent gold from being used, it prevents it from even being necessary to open powerup chests. But when will you ever really need powerup chests, anyways, when you can fly at unlimited speed?
- More in the future? Idk i think that's all there is to this mod. Have fun!
